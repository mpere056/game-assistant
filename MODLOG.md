# Mod log

Every change and test, newest at the bottom. Numbers come with the `runtime/` file they came from.

## 2026-10-08: phase 1 built and tested (in the Attack on Elden Ring repository)
- Plan decided with the user: one core, one adapter per game (Elden Ring first, Minecraft later);
  Claude Haiku 5.5 for talking, routing and vision; Sonnet 5.5 for writing skills; code for
  anything fast; $3/hour spending cap; text first, push-to-talk voice with local speech soon after.
- Built: interface, look-at resolver, spending guard, Elden Ring adapter, live adapter tests,
  Haiku latency test; 12 offline tests pass.
- The Attack on Elden Ring bridge gained a separate assistant ray block (1024 rays, ~1 ms/frame).
- Live adapter tests: 9/9 PASS (Attack on Elden Ring runtime/assistant-adapter-check-20261008-180548.txt).
- Haiku 5.5 latency, 5 runs each, streaming (Attack on Elden Ring
  runtime/assistant-haiku-latency-20261008-181630.txt): first word 641 ms thinking off, 524 ms
  adaptive/low; tool call 596 / 551 ms; look_at called 5/5; 20 calls $0.0011. Chosen: adaptive
  thinking at low effort.

## 2026-10-08: moved to its own repository
- The user wants the assistant in its own repository because it covers several games.
- New layout: `game_assistant/core/` (shared), `game_assistant/games/<game>/` (one adapter per
  game, listed in `game_assistant/games/__init__.py`), `game_assistant/tools/`, `tests/`, `docs/`
  with `docs/games/<game>.md`. Launchers renamed: `Check-Adapter.bat [game]`, `Measure-Haiku.bat`,
  `Run-Tests.bat`, `Setup.bat`. Extracted data goes to `.local/<game>/`; logs to `runtime/`.
- After the move: 12 offline tests pass; the Elden Ring adapter reads the running bridge (title
  screen). The live adapter tests have not been rerun since the move.
